# When Water Wins Over Rock

A delightfully useless but beautifully designed ML project that predicts how many water drops are needed to create a hole in any rock using OpenCV computer vision and machine learning.

## Features

- 🔍 Automatic rock size detection using OpenCV
- 🧠 Machine learning-powered analysis with TensorFlow.js
- 📊 Real-time image processing and dimension extraction
- 🎨 Beautiful gradient UI with glassmorphism effects
- 💧 Scientific water drop calculations with quantum adjustments
- 🪨 Support for various rock materials (Granite, Limestone, Sandstone, etc.)

## The Science Behind the Absurdity

This project combines real computer vision techniques with wonderfully questionable physics to answer the age-old question: "How many water drops does it take to drill through a rock?"

Using advanced algorithms including:
- Edge detection and contour analysis
- Texture analysis for depth estimation
- Mineral composition detection
- Quantum fluctuation corrections (obviously)

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Upload a rock image, select the material, and let science do the rest!
